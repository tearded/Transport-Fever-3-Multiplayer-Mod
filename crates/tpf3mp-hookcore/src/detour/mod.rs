//! An x86-64 inline detour engine.
//!
//! Installing a detour overwrites a function's first instructions with a jump to
//! a replacement, after copying those instructions into a *trampoline* that ends
//! by jumping back into the function. Calling the trampoline therefore runs the
//! original code. The stolen instructions are relocated with iced-x86's block
//! encoder, so a RIP-relative operand still addresses the same absolute memory
//! from its new home; a prologue that cannot be relocated (it branches, returns,
//! or is undecodable) is refused rather than patched wrong.
//!
//! # Why iced-x86 and our own trampoline, not `retour`
//!
//! `retour` (stable 0.3.1; its 0.4 line is alpha) wraps this whole dance behind
//! `GenericDetour`, but it owns trampoline allocation and instruction relocation
//! internally, which is exactly the part we must be able to test and reason
//! about byte for byte on a game binary that shifts every patch. iced-x86 is a
//! pure-Rust decoder and block encoder with no build script and no runtime
//! allocation of its own; we drive the decode/relocate step directly and keep
//! the trampoline and patch code here, where the tests can see them. The engine
//! is x86-64 only by construction; iced-x86 is pulled in only on that target.
//!
//! # Thread-safety
//!
//! Patching overwrites up to fourteen live code bytes with a non-atomic copy.
//! The caller must guarantee the target cannot execute during install or
//! uninstall: either install before the target's first run (the launcher
//! loads the hook before the game's entry point runs: into the suspended game
//! on Windows, by `LD_PRELOAD` on Linux), or park every thread that could
//! reach it first. The engine does not itself stop threads.
