//! What a player did, in terms every replica can resolve against its own
//! world: the portable action schema. `docs/BUILDING.md` ("The action
//! schema") explains what each action carries and why.
//!
//! An action names nothing by engine entity id, which differs between games
//! and is recycled within one. It uses three kinds of reference only:
//!
//! - **world positions**, as fixed-point integers in millimetres ([`Pos`]);
//!   geometry is matched by position within the tolerances BUILDING.md gives;
//! - **resource file names** ([`ResName`]), such as a street type or a
//!   vehicle model, which are the same in every game with the same content;
//! - **canonical ids** ([`CompanyId`], [`LineId`], [`VehicleId`],
//!   [`StationId`]), which the server assigns to what an action creates.
//!
//! The acting player, and so their company, is not part of an action: the
//! event that carries it names the player.
//!
//! An action travels inside the opaque [`Payload`] of an intent, behind the
//! [`ACTION_SCHEMA_VERSION`] ([`Action::to_payload`]). Decoding enforces every
//! bound, and a polyline's links must name its own vertices, so a decoded
//! action is well-formed. Variants are identified by position: append, never
//! reorder, and bump the schema version when an existing variant changes.
