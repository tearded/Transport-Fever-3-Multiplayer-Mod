//! The player's mods for rooms, found and chosen (docs/MODS.md, "Choosing
//! mods"): every mod this player has installed, scanned, and the personal
//! ones they chose to play with.
//!
//! - **Found by themselves**: Mod Hub's cache, the Steam accounts' local
//!   mods and the game's own `mods`, `mods/release` and `dlcs`
//!   (`tpf3mp_modscan::roots`),
//!   each scanned for its class and the first reason for it. The launcher's
//!   `--mods` list overrides all of this (`crate::content::split`).
//! - **Chosen**: a personal mod (a carried one too with
//!   `--personal-game-scripts`) is played with when the player chose it; a
//!   shared mod is never theirs to choose: every player needs the room's.
//! - **The room's mods** come from the owner's start save
//!   ([`Mods::own_start`]): its mods, less the owner's personal ones; or the
//!   owner picks them with a save on the game's Load Game page, with their
//!   settings and the game's own ([`Mods::choose_room`]). The owner declares them to the room with what
//!   players are told of each ([`Declaration::Room`]). The room tells every
//!   other player the list ([`Mods::adopt`], the room's `RoomMods`), who
//!   declares those they have, so that a player with every one of them
//!   matches the owner. A room that tells none is learned from what it says
//!   a game lacks ([`Mods::learn`], the room's `ContentDiff`).
//!
//! What this gives the room: what a player declares
//! ([`Mods::declaration`]) and the lists the room's world loads with in
//! their game ([`Mods::lists`]).
