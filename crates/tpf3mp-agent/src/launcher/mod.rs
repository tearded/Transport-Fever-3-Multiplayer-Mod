//! The launcher: where the player connects, creates or joins a room, gets
//! ready, chats and plays, with this agent doing the work. It is the
//! launcher backend of `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Front ends read its
//! [`State`] and send it [`Action`]s: the native window of the
//! `tpf3mp-launcher` crate through a [`LauncherHandle`], a page in the
//! player's browser (`Launcher::start`), or the Multiplayer window on the
//! game's main menu (D17), over the link to the game's hook ([`lobby`]).
//!
//! The page is served on the loopback interface only. Every API request
//! carries a secret token that only the launched page knows, and requests
//! for any host but the loopback address are refused, so neither other web
//! pages nor DNS rebinding can drive it.
