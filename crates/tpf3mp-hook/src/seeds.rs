//! Seeds: the randomness in Transport Fever 3 that is not a function of the
//! room's state, made one (docs/HOOKS.md, "Seeds, as built";
//! investigation/TPF3_RNG_2026-09-29.md, items 5 to 7).
//!
//! Lockstep needs every replica to draw the same random numbers at the same
//! step. TF3's simulation seeds its generators from game state, with three
//! exceptions the survey found, each a piece here, each independent of the
//! others, each failing closed on its own with its reason in `hook.log`:
//!
//! 1. **The game scripts' `math.random`** is the engine's own `mt19937`,
//!    one per `lua::State`, seeded with the constant 5489 when the state is
//!    created and never saved. The game runs its game scripts on a pool of
//!    such states, one per worker thread of its job pool (with eight or more
//!    hardware threads the engine's shared pool; its own "GameScriptSystem
//!    Pool", of half the threads, only below eight), so which state, and so
//!    which stream, a script's `update` draws from depends on how that
//!    update's jobs were scheduled, which no two machines share. Measured in
//!    a room of three games that loaded one save: `reforestation.script.tl`
//!    planted its first trees at steps 360, 360 and 364, and every build
//!    after that at other steps in each game. So the hook reseeds the state
//!    about to run a script, on the worker thread about to run it, right
//!    before each call: the engine hands that state to a functor first (the
//!    ones `game_script_util::Update`, `PostUpdate` and `HandleEvent` make,
//!    [`UPDATE_CALL_TARGET`], [`POST_UPDATE_CALL_TARGET`] and
//!    [`EVENT_CALL_TARGET`]), and the detour there calls
//!    `math.randomseed(script_seed(step, call, entity))` in it: the room's
//!    step of the update running, which callback, and the game script's
//!    entity. Every script then draws the same numbers at the same step on
//!    every game, whichever state runs it and whatever ran in that state
//!    before. The engine does the same itself for an event that carries a
//!    seed (`HandleEvent`'s `int const*`, through its `lua::State::
//!    RandomSeed`), and such an event keeps the engine's seed. The step
//!    comes from a detour on `ecs::Engine::Update` (the per-update advance,
//!    the one call `GameSim::Step` makes per update, before the systems and
//!    so before `ecs::GameScriptSystem::Update` runs the scripts): per
//!    update, not per call of the game's step, since a call runs a batch of
//!    updates and batches differ per machine. Outside the room's released
//!    updates no step is current and nothing is reseeded: the game's own
//!    randomness, as before.
//! 2. **`TownDevelopAt`** seeds its town developer from the CRT `rand()`,
//!    which the game seeds from the wall clock. The player's
//!    `makeTownDevelopAtCmd` is refused in a room already (the mod's
//!    `guard.lua`, docs/HOOKS.md "The player's commands"); the
//!    alternative for later is here behind [`TOWN_DEVELOP_RESEED`]: a
//!    detour on `TownDevelopAt::Apply` that calls the CRT's `srand` on the
//!    applying thread with a seed from the step and the command's number
//!    within the step, right before the original runs.
//! 3. **The CRT's transcendental dispatch** (`sinf`, `cosf`, ... pick an
//!    FMA3 or an SSE2 body at run time by CPU) is a measurement, not a fix:
//!    [`cpu_report`] goes to `hook.log` at bootstrap so two replicas' logs
//!    say whether their CRTs took the same path.
//!
//! The seed is [`seed_for`]: a `splitmix64` mix of the step and a salt,
//! folded to `1..=0x7fff_ffff` (an `mt19937` takes a 32-bit seed, the
//! engine's `math.randomseed` reads an integer, and `minstd_rand` treats 0
//! as 1, so the range suits every generator here). A script call's salt is
//! [`script_salt`]: the call's kind and the script's entity, never the state
//! or the thread, which differ per machine.
//!
//! The detours that hand control to this module are assembly thunks: they
//! save the four argument registers and `xmm0`-`xmm3` (the targets take
//! floats in them: `ecs::Engine::Update(engine, float dt)`), call the
//! Rust side, restore, and jump to the original's trampoline. So nothing
//! here assumes a target's signature, and the original sees its stack and
//! registers exactly as its caller left them.

#![allow(unsafe_code)]
// Elsewhere the detours are not installed, so their code is unused there.
