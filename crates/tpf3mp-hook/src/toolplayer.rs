//! The GUI's native tools act as the player's company in a room
//! (docs/HOOKS.md, "The tools' player"; investigation/
//! TF3_LOCAL_PLAYER_2026-10-01.md, "Why the street tool will not split a
//! road the room built").
//!
//! `UI::CGameUI`'s constructor reads the save's player once and hands a copy
//! to each tool it builds. The room builds every road, track and
//! construction for the acting company (`PlayerOwned` = the company), so to
//! a player of any company but the room's first, the native tools take the
//! company's own edges for another player's: no split in the middle of a
//! road (`sub_610ea0` from the street builder's snap), no bulldozing, no
//! tram track onto its rail. This writes the company the GUI notes
//! (`note("tpf3mp.company")`, `tpf3mp/follow.lua`) into six tools' own
//! copies, at the start of each tool's frame, on the main thread:
//!
//! - `UI::StreetBuilder` (the street and the track builder, one class built
//!   twice), its player at `+0xc0` (the constructor's store, profile target
//!   [`STREET_STORE`]);
//! - `UI::TrackModifier` (the road and track modifiers: tram track, bus
//!   lane, electrification, ...), its player at `+0xa0` ([`MODIFIER_STORE`]);
//! - `UI::ConstructionBuilder` (stations, depots, every construction the
//!   menu places), `+0xa0` ([`CONSTRUCTION_STORE`]);
//! - `UI::StreetTerminalBuilder` (the stop builder, and the signal and
//!   waypoint builder, a second instance), `+0xa0` ([`TERMINAL_STORE`]);
//! - `UI::ModuleBuilder` (a station's modules), `+0xa8` ([`MODULE_STORE`]);
//! - `UI::Bulldozer`: its own player at `+0x28`, which its proposals are
//!   made for ([`BULLDOZER_STORE`]), and the one entry of its
//!   `BulldozerFilter`'s player list (`[[+0xc0] + 0x10]`,
//!   [`BULLDOZER_FILTER`]), which every bulldozer action asks
//!   (`sub_5f7db0`).
//!
//! Each is a UI object, made by `CGameUI` and read by its own class's code
//! only (the readers are listed in the profile). Nothing the simulation
//! runs reads them: the builds a tool makes are stopped at their apply and
//! built by the room as the acting company's, which every game checks
//! (`companies.mayTouch`). A value is written only where the field holds the
//! save's player (as the mod's game script notes it) or the company this
//! wrote; anything else is left alone and said once. Outside a room, for
//! the room's first company, while either note is missing, or with
//! [`ENV`]`=0`, the game's own value stays (and one this wrote goes back).
