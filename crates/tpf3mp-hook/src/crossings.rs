//! Read the level crossing window's type change at `CommandList::Add`.
//!
//! Clicking a crossing opens `RailroadCrossingContent`, whose native
//! `RailroadCrossingComp` changes the crossing's type with a
//! `WorldBuildProposal` it queues itself (playerInitiated 1): no Lua runs and
//! game scripts hear of no proposal, so in a room the click was stopped at
//! the apply with nothing said (2026-10-16). The window's call of `Add` is
//! told by where it returns to; there its proposal is read, checked for the
//! one shape the room carries, and kept for the click (the same queue as the
//! module editor's, [`crate::modules::keep`]), as the crossing and its new
//! type or why it is not carried. A recognised click always keeps an answer,
//! so the GUI never hands a preview of another tool for it.
//!
//! The shape carried (build 40420, read statically; docs/HOOKS.md, "Level
//! crossing types"): no geometry, no node configuration, an empty
//! `node2rcType`, and one entry in the window's own crossing -> type map.
//! The window's other shape rebuilds the crossing's segments and maps its
//! nodes instead; that one is refused, as is anything else.
