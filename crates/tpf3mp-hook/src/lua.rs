//! The hook's half of the link to the Lua mod (docs/HOOKS.md, "The Lua
//! side"): the `tpf3mp_native` table, and the queues between it and the
//! step gate.
//!
//! The hook detours Lua's `print` and adds `tpf3mp_native` to the globals
//! of every Lua state that calls it, once; the mod calls `print` before it
//! looks for the table. The game runs Lua in several states: the GUI's on
//! the main thread and the game scripts' on a pool of simulation threads.
//! So the table's functions share nothing but [`SHARED`], behind a lock:
//!
//! - `command(action, password)`: the player acted. The table is read into a
//!   [`LuaValue`] tree within [`MAX_DEPTH`] and [`MAX_NODES`], converted with
//!   the schema ([`action_from_lua`]) and queued for the step gate, which
//!   hands it to the room ([`take_commands`]). Returns `true` and a ticket,
//!   or `false` and why: an action that was not queued must not happen at
//!   all. The ticket comes back in `results()` when this game applies the
//!   action, or when it never will. A password, for joining or locking a
//!   company only, goes with the action to the room, which seals it
//!   ([`tpf3mp_proto::Secret`]); nothing here logs it.
//! - `take()`: marks one simulation update begun, so the last update of a
//!   batch can read checkpoint lanes. Runtime action batches use the
//!   engine-event path below; `take()` also supports the legacy batch
//!   action tables in the link's isolated tests.
//! - `takeReplay(token)`: the engine event takes the matching ordered
//!   actions once, plus their player identities and seals. The hook keeps
//!   the actions until this call; the GUI carries only a wake token.
//! - `replayed(token, ok, why)`: the engine script has applied and reported
//!   every action and persisted its state, or failed. The step gate then
//!   releases updates and world operations, or holds the world.
//! - `log(line)`: a line for `hook.log`.
//! - `poll()`: in the GUI, every frame: what the hook asks of the game, a
//!   table `{ replay = token }`, `{ save = name }` or `{ load = name }` (a save of the game's own
//!   save folder), once, or `nil`. The GUI saves with `app.saveGame` and
//!   loads with `app.loadGame` ([`request_save`], [`request_load`]).
//! - `saved(name, ok, why)`: the GUI's answer to a save ([`take_save_answer`]).
//! - `world()`: a world's GUI started. Once the GUI (or the main menu, for
//!   a game with no world up: [`request_menu_load`], `crate::menu`) has
//!   taken a load, the next world to start is the one it loaded
//!   ([`load_done`]). Before the
//!   room begins a game, the step gate tells the agent of each new world
//!   ([`take_world_up`]), which marks the player ready.
//! - `room()`: whether the room's game runs ([`set_in_room`]): the GUI then
//!   refuses the player's commands the room cannot carry yet (docs/HOOKS.md,
//!   "The player's commands").
//! - `checkpoint()`: in a game script's `postUpdate`: whether this update is
//!   the last of a batch that ends at a checkpoint step, so the script reads
//!   the world's lanes now. The updates of a batch are counted by their
//!   `take()`.
//! - `lanes(t)`: the lanes read there, a table from lane numbers to strings,
//!   which the step gate reports as digests ([`end_batch`]). Returns `true`,
//!   or `false` and why.
//! - `clicks()`: in the GUI: the player's builds queued in the room's game
//!   so far, or `nil` where the hook cannot take them to the room
//!   ([`crate::builds`]).
//! - `built(n)`: in the GUI: the build the module editor queued at click
//!   `n`, read natively, as game scripts see a proposal, or a terrain
//!   tool's stroke as `{ terrain = grid }` ([`crate::terrain`]); `nil` and
//!   why when it did not read; `nil` when click `n` was neither's
//!   ([`crate::modules`]). Optional in the contract: a mod that does not
//!   call it keeps both refused.
//! - `replaying(on)`: the game script begins or ends applying the room's
//!   actions, whose builds the hook lets through ([`crate::builds`]).
//! - `terrain(t)`: in a game script's `postUpdate`, while the room's actions
//!   run: arms the next build it sends with the terraform `t` (`{ x0 =, y0
//!   =, width =, height =, cells = { ... } }`), which the hook fills in at
//!   the build's apply ([`crate::terrain`]). Returns `true`, or `nil` and
//!   why. `terrain()` disarms, and answers whether a build was filled
//!   (`nil` when none was armed). Optional in the contract: a hook without
//!   it applies no terraform.
//! - `applied(index, ok, entity, why)`: in a game script's `postUpdate`,
//!   after applying the batch's action `index` (from 1): whether it went,
//!   what it made, if anything, and why not. For one of the player's own,
//!   the ticket's answer.
//! - `results()`: in the GUI: the answers since the last call, a list of
//!   `{ ticket =, ok =, entity =, why = }`, oldest first ([`refused`]).
//! - `dump()`: in a game script's `postUpdate`, at a checkpoint whose lanes
//!   the driver wants dumped ([`crate::lanedump`]): `{ step =, lanes = {
//!   ... }, box = { x0, y0, x1, y1 } }` (`box` only when the network lane
//!   is cut to one), once, or `nil`. Optional in the contract, as `dumped`
//!   is.
//! - `dumped(lane, entry)`: one entry of a lane dumped there, which goes to
//!   `hook.log` as `lane <lane> step <step> <entry>`, up to
//!   [`MAX_DUMP_LINES`] a checkpoint. Returns `true`, or `false` once no
//!   more are taken.
//! - `note(key[, value])`: a short string one Lua state notes for the
//!   others ([`native_note`]).
//! - `edgewatch()`: in a game script's `update`: the entities to watch in
//!   this update, a list, or `nil` (the edge watch is off or this step is
//!   outside its window, [`crate::edgewatch`]).
//! - `edgewatched(entity, text)`: what the script read of a watched entity
//!   in this update's `postUpdate`; the hook logs it when it changed. Both
//!   optional in the contract.
//! - `preview(action)`: in the GUI: what the player's build tool shows now,
//!   the action its proposal would build, or `nil` once it shows nothing,
//!   for the room's other members to see ([`crate::previews`]). Returns
//!   `true`, or `false` and why (an action the schema does not take, or
//!   one over `tpf3mp_proto::MAX_PREVIEW`). Never applied, in any game.
//! - `previews()`: in the GUI: what the other members' tools show that
//!   changed since the last call, `{ { from =, action = }, ... }`, `from`
//!   as 64 hex digits and `action` as `take()` gives one, absent once that
//!   member's tool shows nothing. Both optional in the contract.
//! - `draw(from)`, `drawn()` and `undraw(from)`: in the GUI, draws another
//!   member's preview ([`crate::drawing`]): `draw` arms the GUI thread for
//!   member `from` (64 hex digits), the GUI then has the game evaluate the
//!   preview's proposal (`api.engine.util.proposal.makeProposalData`), which
//!   the hook draws in that member's renderer, and `drawn` disarms: `true`,
//!   or `false` and why, or `nil` when the game evaluated nothing. `undraw`
//!   clears the member's renderer. Optional in the contract.
//! - `version`: [`VERSION`].
//!
//! Everything reaches Lua through [`LuaApi`]: in the game, the C API
//! functions the build profile names (Lua 5.2); in the tests, Lua 5.1's
//! through small adapters. No function here calls into Lua code, so a Lua
//! error can only come from the API itself running out of memory.
