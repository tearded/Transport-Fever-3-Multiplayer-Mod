//! The rolling world checks' static lanes read natively, a part at a time
//! (docs/HOOKS.md, "The network lane read natively"): the rows
//! `tpf3mp/lanes.lua` builds from the street and track edges, junctions and
//! constructions, the same text, from the engine's memory instead of a
//! `getComponent` call and a dozen field reads an object ([`read_part`]).
//!
//! [`ENV`] sets it: off (the default), `on`, where a room's rolling history
//! is kept in native parts, or `compare`, where the mod also reads each
//! part in Lua, compares the rows and hashes its own. The full readers
//! ([`network`], [`construction_rows`]) remain for the tests that hold the
//! rows to the mod's Lua.
//!
//! Where it reads (investigation/TF3_NATIVE_NETWORK_2026-10-04.md; the
//! offsets are the build's, in its native bundle):
//!
//! - the engine, `[CGameTime+8]`, from the `CGameTime` the game's own step
//!   called its speed getter on; only while that step runs, so only inside
//!   the game script's `postUpdate`, where the mod reads its lanes, and
//!   never on another thread's call;
//! - the `BaseEdge` pool, the one of the engine's pools whose vtable is
//!   `CompVec<BaseEdge>`'s, its type id its index there (and its own
//!   record of it, which must agree);
//! - every entity whose component bits hold that type id, its data index
//!   from its component list, its `BaseEdge` from the pool's dense vector
//!   or its pages.
//!
//! Fail closed: anything that does not read as the layout says (a pointer
//! out of order, a count past its bound, an entity whose bits and list
//! disagree, a number that is not finite) fails the whole read with why,
//! and the room's history of parts holds. Nothing is written, nothing of
//! the game's is called.
