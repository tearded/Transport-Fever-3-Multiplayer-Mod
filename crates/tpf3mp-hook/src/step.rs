//! The step gate in the game: what the detour on the game's simulation step
//! does each time the game calls it.
//!
//! Transport Fever 3's `GameSim::Step` (as TPF2's) is one batch of the
//! game's own pacing: the main thread calls it on its schedule, and it runs
//! as many simulation updates as its call of the speed getter answers: one
//! at 1x, none while paused, which takes the game's own paused path. The
//! renderer interpolates from each batch, so every call must run: a call
//! skipped looks to the game like a batch that ran without the world moving
//! on, and its clock goes back (TF3 then fails an assertion in its
//! particles). So the detour runs the game's step exactly once per call, and
//! [`StepDriver::on_step`] says how many updates that call runs:
//!
//! - as many as the room has released, up to [`MAX_STEPS_PER_CALL`] and to
//!   the next checkpoint step, so a room faster than the game's own pace
//!   catches up;
//! - none while the room withholds the next step (the room is paused, or a
//!   player is behind): the game's paused path, and the world stands still;
//! - before a room has begun a game, and after it has ended, what the
//!   game's own speed says; before, each new world the player's game has up
//!   is told to the agent, which marks the player ready in the room's lobby
//!   ([`RoomGate::world_up`]);
//! - while the game saves its world for the room, or loads the room's
//!   (docs/HOOKS.md, "The room's world"), none;
//! - with no world up at all, at the game's main menu, no call comes: the
//!   menu's own frame drives [`StepDriver::on_menu`] instead, which follows
//!   the room until its game begins, tells the agent the game is at its
//!   menu, and starts a load of the room's save from there;
//! - on anything it cannot follow (the agent gone, a malformed message, a
//!   room's world that did not load, a world up the room never loaded:
//!   [`WorldMark`]) none, for good: the world stands still
//!   rather than run on apart from the room's (fail closed).
//!
//! Answering the step's own speed call rather than skipping calls is how
//! TPF2MP paced TPF2 (`tpf2-multiplayer/native/src/speedhook.cpp`, which
//! also describes the game's batch pacing).
//!
//! A batch that ends at a checkpoint step asks the game for the world's
//! lanes: the mod's game script reads them after the batch's last update
//! (docs/HOOKS.md, "The world's lanes"), and the driver reports their
//! digests for that step. A batch that does not bring them holds the world.
//!
//! Ordered actions run between simulation updates through the game's
//! engine-event path. The driver queues a token-only GUI wake and holds
//! steps, saves and loads until the game script has applied the actions
//! and stored its state. This also works while paused, and every replica
//! uses the same phase when running. No simulation update is invented.
//!
//! This module knows nothing of the process: the detour hands it the
//! game's step as a closure, and the room's side is a [`RoomGate`], the
//! real [`Session`] in the game and a script in the tests.
