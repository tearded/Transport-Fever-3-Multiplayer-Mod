//! The build tools in the room's game (docs/HOOKS.md, "The build tools").
//!
//! The street, track and construction tools of Transport Fever 3 are
//! native: they queue a `WorldBuildProposal` command, which the simulation
//! applies at its next step, in this game alone. Nothing on the Lua side can
//! stop one (the tools send no `builder.proposalPrepareForApply`, the game
//! ignores an error raised in `onPreBuildProposal`, and emptying the
//! proposal there crashes it), so the hook does, in two places:
//!
//! - **At the click**, `CommandList::Add` on the main thread: a player's
//!   build queued in the room's game is counted ([`clicks`]). The mod's GUI
//!   keeps the proposal each preview showed, marked with the count it saw,
//!   so the one it saw last before the count went up is the one clicked, and
//!   hands that to the room.
//! - **At the apply**, the simulation's `WorldBuildProposal` apply: a
//!   player-initiated build in the room's game answers false, as a build the
//!   game refused, unless it is the room's own, which the mod's game script
//!   applies with the flag [`set_replaying`] up. The game then tells the
//!   tool it failed, through its own path; the room orders the build for
//!   every game, this one included.
//!
//! The command's layout is the build's own (build 40408's): a `Command`'s
//! payload pointer at +0, the payload's variant index at +0x9b8 (the
//! dispatcher's case minus one), and a `WorldBuildProposal` payload's
//! `playerInitiated` at +0x3d2. A build whose profile has not these targets
//! installs nothing here, and the GUI keeps refusing the tools.
//!
//! The module editor tells game scripts nothing of its proposals, so the GUI
//! has no preview to pair its click with. The add's detour is entered
//! through a thunk that notes where `Add` returns to; a click whose call
//! returns into the module editor's `MousePressed` has its proposal read
//! natively and kept for that click ([`crate::modules`]). A click whose call
//! returns into `ProposalAction::DoApply`, the terrain tools', the painter's
//! and the asset brush's, has its terraform read there ([`crate::terrain`]).
//! While the room's actions are applied, a build is filled with the
//! terraform the game script armed, if it armed one.
//!
//! Only Windows x64 installs the detours ([`install`]); elsewhere they are
//! built for the tests alone.
