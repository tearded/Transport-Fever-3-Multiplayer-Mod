//! A model of the game that plays the portable action schema
//! ([`tpf3mp_proto::action`]): streets and tracks, constructions, stations,
//! depots, vehicles, lines and companies, with a small deterministic
//! simulation of vehicles carrying passengers along their lines. It stands
//! in for Transport Fever 3 in the regression harness until the hook applies
//! actions to the real game, and it is held to the same rules the hook is:
//!
//! - an action is applied whole or not at all. One that does not fit this
//!   world (an edge that is not there, a line of someone else's, too little
//!   money) changes nothing and is counted as ignored, the same on every
//!   replica, since every replica applies the same events to the same world;
//! - references resolve by position within the tolerances `docs/BUILDING.md`
//!   gives, and canonical ids count up in the order the room applied what
//!   created them.
//!
//! Its state is compared through checkpoint lanes, and
//! [`ModelWorld::with_drift`] perturbs its simulation the way a platform's
//! float difference would, so a test can show the harness catches it.
