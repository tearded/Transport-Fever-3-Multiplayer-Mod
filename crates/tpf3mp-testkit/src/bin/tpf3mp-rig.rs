//! A multiplayer test rig on one PC: starts several games, each with its
//! own agent (a headless launcher in this process), its own data folder
//! and its own link name, and puts them all in one room. The first player
//! hosts and the others join its invite. Until Transport Fever 3 is out,
//! the games are fake ones (`tpf3mp-fakegame`); a real game is started as
//! the launcher starts it, with the hook loaded into it (`tpf3mp-launch`),
//! and told its link, data folder and starter through the environment its
//! hook reads (`TPF3MP_GAME_LINK`, `TPF3MP_DATA_DIR`,
//! `TPF3MP_LAUNCHER_PID`).
//!
//! It runs until every game has exited, or Ctrl-C or the end of its
//! --time-limit, which stop everything it started. When the games print their lane digests, as the fake game
//! does, it checks that all of them ended in the same world.
