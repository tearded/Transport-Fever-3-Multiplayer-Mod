-- TPF3-MP in the game's GUI state: the plugin gui/tpf3mp/tpf3mp.res.lua
-- names. On the first step of a game it loads the mod's modules and links
-- to the hook (tpf3mp/bridge.lua). Without a hook, which is every game Steam
-- started, it logs one line and does nothing more. The room's actions are
-- applied by the mod's game script (tpf3mp_sim/), not here.
--
-- Every frame it does what the hook asks (docs/HOOKS.md, "The room's
-- world"): save the world under a name when the room orders a save, or load
-- the room's world from the game's save folder. It tells the hook each time
-- a world's GUI starts, which is how the hook sees a load finish.
--
-- Once linked, it puts the guard in front of the GUI's commands
-- (tpf3mp/guard.lua; docs/HOOKS.md, "The player's commands"): in the room's
-- game a command the room carries goes to the room, and its window hears
-- what became of it once this game has applied it; a command the room
-- cannot carry yet is refused, and the game bar says so for a few seconds.
-- The guard names vehicles, lines, station groups and towns by the canonical
-- ids the mod's game script keeps in its state (tpf3mp/registry.lua).
--
-- It follows what mods made for Transport Fever 3 build 40391 rely on
-- (investigation/TF3_MODS_2026-09-27.md): a .script.lua defines data();
-- ug_require loads the game's files ("::/...") and a mod's own
-- ("tpf3mp_1::/..."); a GameBarInfoDisplayExtension plugin with
-- react.onStep runs code every frame in a game; debugPrint writes to the
-- game's log. Each step logs "[tpf3mp]" lines, so the log shows how far a
-- game got on release day.
--
-- In the room's game the game bar also shows the room in one line (its
-- name, who is there, its speed, whether the worlds match), a button that
-- opens the Multiplayer window: the room, its players, its speed, whether
-- this world matches the room's, and the room's chat, which the player can
-- write to (docs/PLAN.md: the in-game Multiplayer panel for a game the
-- launcher started; the lobby stays in the launcher). The game's window
-- container shows the window, and the game's area for mods' buttons has a
-- second button for it (a second plugin, tpf3mp_button.res.lua). What
-- they show is kept in package.loaded["tpf3mp.ui"], which the game bar
-- plugin fills every frame from the hook (tpf3mp/bridge.lua: status, chat,
-- say).
