-- TPF3-MP's game script (tpf3mp_sim.gs.lua names it): where every game
-- applies the actions the room ordered, all in the same simulation update,
-- and reads the world's lanes at checkpoints (docs/HOOKS.md, "Actions in
-- the game" and "The world's lanes").
--
-- The game runs a game script's `update` once per simulation update, in an
-- engine state, where a command runs at once (build 40408, measured: the
-- update count goes up by one from call to call, dt 0.2). It runs game
-- scripts on a pool of Lua states, so what this file keeps is kept once per
-- state; the link to the hook is looked up in each. The game's own scripts
-- decide in `update` and act in `postUpdate`, which the game calls with
-- what `update` returned, and not when that is nil: company.script.tl
-- reads its argument unchecked, and a postUpdate after an update that
-- returned nothing never read a lane on build 40408. This one does the
-- same, so the world changes only in `postUpdate`:
--
-- - `update` asks the hook for the actions the room ordered (`take`), which
--   the hook hands only to the first update of the step they were ordered
--   for, the same update on every game, and whether this update ends a
--   batch at a checkpoint step (`checkpoint`). It returns both, or nil.
-- - `postUpdate` applies the actions (tpf3mp/apply.lua) and, at a
--   checkpoint, reads the world's lanes (tpf3mp/lanes.lua) and hands them
--   to the hook (`lanes`), which reports them to the room. When the hook
--   asks (`dump`: after a divergence, or TPF3MP_HOOK_LANE_DUMP), it also
--   hands it the lanes asked for entry by entry, for hook.log (docs/HOOKS.md,
--   "Lane dumps").
--
-- With the hook's edge watch on (TPF3MP_HOOK_EDGE_WATCH), `update` also
-- asks which entities to read (`edgewatch`), and `postUpdate` reads each
-- after everything else it does and hands it over (`edgewatched`;
-- docs/HOOKS.md, "The edge watch"). Read only.
--
-- The hook holds the world if nobody took the actions, or if a checkpoint's
-- lanes did not come.
--
-- `guiHandleEvent` runs in the GUI's state, where the game's own build
-- tools (streets, tracks, stations and depots, stops on streets, the
-- bulldozer) tell game scripts of every proposal they make
-- (`builder.proposalCreate`), and
-- honour an error returned for it, as the game's company script does with
-- its permits (docs/HOOKS.md, "The build tools"). In the room's game:
--
-- - where the hook stops the player's builds (`clicks` is not nil), a
--   proposal of a tool the room carries (CAPTURE) is kept as the action it
--   makes (tpf3mp/capture.lua), marked with the clicks counted so far, and
--   builds nothing here: the hook answers false when the game applies it.
--   `guiUpdate` hands the room the one each click saw last, and the room
--   orders it for every game, this one included;
-- - every other proposal gets an error, so those tools build nothing.
--
-- The module editor tells game scripts nothing on build 40408 (CAPTURE):
-- the hook reads its build natively at the click, and `guiUpdate` takes it
-- for that click (tpf3mp_native.built), ahead of any preview, and makes the
-- edit of it as of the construction tool's proposal. The terrain tools
-- tell them nothing either: the hook reads a stroke's height grid at the
-- click the same way, and `guiUpdate` hands the room Terraform actions of
-- it (tpf3mp/capture.lua terraform), which every game applies through the
-- hook (tpf3mp/apply.lua) once tpf3mp/acceptance.lua's `terraform` is on.
-- A click with neither is stopped with "no proposal seen".
--
-- Each upgrade (a road or track modifier's build) and each terraform is
-- said in the hook's log when handed to the room and when applied. Every
-- event of the room's game the script does not handle is logged by id and
-- name, once each, a few dozen at most.
--
-- `handleEvent` takes the event `command` of id "tpf3mp" (sent with
-- api.cmd.makeScriptingSendEventCmd) and hands its parameter, an action
-- table, to the room: a way to act from the console, for tests. The event
-- reaches this game's scripts only, so only this game hands the action over;
-- the room then orders it for every game.
--
-- With more than one company in the room, it samples the companies'
-- scores four times a game month, the same game time in every game, and
-- keeps their ranks (tpf3mp/progression.lua, docs/HOOKS.md "Company
-- ranks"), each town's parts and each score said in the hook's log.
--
-- It also hears the company script's `startProspection` and
-- `endProspection` (game_mechanics/company/company.script.tl), which every
-- game's company script sends at the same update, and says in the hook's
-- log when a prospection began and what it found. A prospection that found
-- an industry binds it in the registry at once, so every game names it by
-- the same id (docs/HOOKS.md, "Prospecting").
