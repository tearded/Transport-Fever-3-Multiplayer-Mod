-- An action table mirrors tpf3mp_proto::action::Action field for field, in
-- the game's units: metres, and plain fractions for directions. The hook
-- converts it to and from the schema (tpf3mp_proto::lua), so the rounding,
-- the bounds and the checks live in Rust alone; `command` returns false and
-- a reason for a table the schema refuses.
--
-- `command` is Session::command (docs/HOOKS.md, "The hook's session"). An
-- action the room orders comes back to every game, the one that sent it
-- included, through `take`: the hook hands it to the first simulation update
-- of the step it was ordered for, and the mod's game script
-- (tpf3mp_sim/tpf3mp_sim.script.lua) applies it there, where a command runs
-- at once, so every game applies it in the same update.
--
-- Without the table the game is the plain game, and attach() says so. The
-- mod then does nothing. With a table of another version, or one missing a
-- function, attach() refuses it rather than guessing (fail closed).
--
-- Pure Lua; the tests hand attach() a fake table.
