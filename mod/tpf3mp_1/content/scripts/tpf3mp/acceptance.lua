-- New channels remain refused until ordinary two-game acceptance is recorded.
-- These defaults travel with the mod fingerprint: every room member has the
-- same settings. Fixtures may enable a channel explicitly to test its mechanics.
-- Height brushes passed local two-game acceptance on build 40408, 2026-10-02.
-- See investigation/STATION_TERRAIN_2026-10-02.md for evidence and limits.
-- Bridge/tunnel window rebuilds use ordinary road/track actions, gated at
-- capture.windowBuild; they passed local two-game acceptance on build
-- 40420, 2026-10-11 (track and road bridges, a road tunnel, a road bridge
-- with a stop on it): investigation/TPF3_BRIDGE_TUNNEL_WINDOW_2026-10-11.md.
-- Signals a script places along tracks (PlaceSignals: Auto Signals) passed
-- local two-game acceptance on build 40408, 2026-10-06 (runs
-- run-1006-225251 and run-1006-230635; docs/MODS.md).
-- Signals kept on the pieces of a track cut between them (splitSignals:
-- a track started or ended there, Link.kept) passed local two-game
-- acceptance on build 40420, 2026-10-17 (run-1017-024110, Japan_2: two
-- cuts by a moved node, each signal applied in both games and moved
-- 0.00 m, every checkpoint's free-id fingerprint equal).
-- A signal the track tool puts back where it stood (refitSignals: a track
-- started close to a node of a track with signals, the tool replacing the
-- signal on the edge whose node it removes) is captured as the old signal
-- kept on that piece, a split's Link.kept on the wire; only the capture
-- asks this gate (tpf3mp/engine.lua refitSignals). It passed two-player
-- acceptance on build 40420, 2026-10-17 (run-1017-refit2, Japan_2: one
-- build by each player, a mod's signal and the game's own, each put back
-- on the piece between the tool's own nodes about the removed one, kept in
-- both games and moved 0.00 and 0.01 m, every rolling world check equal).
-- Subsidies passed local two-game acceptance on build 40408, 2026-10-07:
-- investigation/TPF3_SUBSIDIES_2026-10-07.md.
-- Line waypoints passed local two-game acceptance on build 40420, 2026-10-16:
-- a line edited with waypoints in a room, both games' rolling world checks alike.
-- Terrain paint and the asset brush (action schema 27) passed local two-game
-- acceptance on build 40420, 2026-10-16: paint strokes of several sizes, the
-- large ones in bands, and tree strokes of 78 and 124 trees, alike in both.
-- The crossing type-only path has staged Japan_2 runs, but not ordinary-start
-- two-player acceptance yet; keep it refused until that run is recorded.
-- The road and track tools' toolbar crossing type (BuildRoad/BuildTrack
-- crossing_type, schema 28) passed staged two-game runs on build 40420,
-- 2026-10-17, on Japan_2 (crossing-tool-1017b, crossing-tool-1017c); off
-- until the owner takes them, or an ordinary-start run, as its acceptance.
-- While off, a road/track build uses the established, checked build channel
-- without a toolbar preference; the engine picks the crossing type.
-- Construction rejoin's two native commands have no proven atomic failure
-- path; while off, a refused first proposal cannot remove any existing track.
