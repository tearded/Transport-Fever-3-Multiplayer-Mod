-- tpf3mp/previews.lua -- what the players' build tools show, in a room's
-- game (docs/HOOKS.md, "Build previews"): the player's own goes to the
-- room's other members, and theirs come here to be shown. Advisory: nothing
-- here builds, sends a command or touches the world.
--
-- - **Out.** The game script's GUI half hands over the action each of the
--   player's tool proposals would build, as the capture made it
--   (tpf3mp/capture.lua), for the tools whose builds can be shown (SHOWN):
--   `shown`. It hides it when the tool shows nothing (an empty proposal, a
--   proposal the room cannot carry, a click, which the room then orders as
--   the real build) and when the game's own list of active tools is no
--   longer what it was at the tool's last proposal (`tick`): build 40408
--   names its tools there by their window ("Construction",
--   "variant-tracks"), never by the event's id ("streetBuilder"), so a
--   change of the list is the tool closing or another opening. The hook
--   sends it on, at most five times a second, and again every two seconds
--   while it shows (crates/tpf3mp-hook/src/previews.rs).
-- - **In.** The Multiplayer plugin (gui/tpf3mp/tpf3mp.script.lua), which
--   stays mounted in the game bar, takes what changed of the other members'
--   previews (`take`) and makes each into the proposal it would build in
--   this game (tpf3mp/apply.lua, apply.proposalOf), never sent, and has
--   the hook draw it (`draw`, given by the plugin: the hook's renderer for
--   that member, crates/tpf3mp-hook/src/drawing.rs), in 3D as the tools
--   draw theirs; one gone it clears. The game's own
--   `builtin.ProposalViewer` cannot: build 40408 allows it only inside a
--   tool's ActionDescriptor and fails fatally anywhere else
--   (`!IsTransformWithContext`). Each member's first preview, the first
--   drawn, and why one does not show are said in the log, and what this
--   game says of a member's preview each time that changes (`verdict`): a
--   preview drawn red is one this game calls critical or finds errors in.
--
-- Ported from TpF2 Multiplayer's shared build previews (mp/previews.lua in
-- tpf2-multiplayer), on the room's own action schema.

-- Pure Lua; the tests hand it a fake link and a fake api.
