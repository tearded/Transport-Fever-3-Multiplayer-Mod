# Working on TPF3-MP

How changes are made and released, for people and coding agents alike. Read
this before changing anything. [README.md](README.md) says what the project
is, for players; [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) where it stands
and how to build it; [docs/GAME_TESTING.md](docs/GAME_TESTING.md) how to
test in the real game; `docs/` says how it works. Check every task against
[docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md) and [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md)
first, and flag a conflict instead of working around it ("Before starting
a task" below).

## Branches

Changes move through three long-lived branches, always in this order:

```
feature branch ──> dev ──> acceptance ──> main
 (your work)     (testing) (release     (release: CI/CD drafts
                            candidate)    the release)
```

| branch | holds | may receive | gate to the next |
|---|---|---|---|
| feature (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`) | one change in progress | your commits | `ci` green on the branch |
| `dev` | the integration and testing line | pull requests from feature branches whose `ci` is green; a change to `docs/DECISIONS.md` or `docs/PLAN.md` also needs the owner's approval | `ci` green on `dev` |
| `acceptance` | the release candidate | fast-forwards from `dev` | `ci` **and** `acceptance` green on `acceptance`, plus the manual checks below |
| `main` | what is released | fast-forwards from `acceptance` | the `release` workflow drafts the release |

Rules:

- **Never commit to `dev`, `acceptance` or `main` directly.** Work on a
  feature branch cut from `dev`, and merge it in once its `ci` is green.
- **Promote by fast-forward only.** `acceptance` and `main` never get
  commits of their own, so each always equals an earlier state of the
  branch before it, and a release is exactly a commit that passed every
  check. Force-pushes to these branches are never allowed.
- **Do not skip a stage.** Nothing reaches `main` without passing
  `acceptance` first, however small the change. A fix found in
  acceptance goes in on a feature branch, then through `dev` again.
- **A red check stops promotion.** Fix it on a feature branch; never
  promote around it or disable the check.
- New work starts from `dev`. Only `dev`, `acceptance`, `main` and
  branches in progress exist; delete a feature branch once `main` has it.
  The old milestone branches are kept as the tags
  `archive/m0-foundations` and `archive/m1-core`, and review
  proof-of-concept tests never merged as `archive/review-snapshots`.
- **Pull requests into `main` or `acceptance` are not the way in.**
  Merging one creates a commit that no check has seen and skips the stage
  before. Open pull requests into `dev` if you want a review; promote with
  the fast-forwards below.
- Contributors may freely propose decision changes and alternative designs in
  pull requests. Explain the trade-offs; the owner decides whether to adopt them.

### What GitHub enforces

`tools/github/protect-branches.sh`, run once by a repository administrator,
makes GitHub hold everyone, administrators included, to the rules above:

- `dev`, `acceptance` and `main` cannot be force-pushed or deleted;
- `acceptance` takes only commits whose `ci` checks passed;
- `main` takes only commits whose `ci` and `acceptance` checks passed.

A promotion pushes a commit already tested on the branch before, so it
passes; a merge commit made on `acceptance` or `main` has no checks and is
refused. When a job in `ci.yml` or `acceptance.yml` is renamed or added,
update the script's lists and run it again.

## The checks

- **`ci`** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs on every push and pull request,
  on Windows, Linux and macOS:
  - `cargo fmt --check`;
  - `clippy -D warnings`;
  - the whole test suite;
  - release builds of the binaries players and servers run;
  - the server container image;
  - that the launcher page's script parses;
  - on Linux, format, lint and tests of the binary-analysis kit
    `tools/tpfre` (D14), its own Cargo workspace.
  - on Linux, the release-day tools' tests (`tools/dayone`), the lane
    dump diff's (`tools/test_lane_diff.py`) and a real
    Lua's parse of the probe mods (`tools/probe/check_lua.py`).
- **`acceptance`** (`.github/workflows/acceptance.yml`) runs on pushes to
  `acceptance`. It runs optimized load tests on all three platforms, each
  failing on any failed bot or diverged replica:
  - rooms of bots at the room's pace;
  - a bad network (latency, jitter, loss);
  - every bot through the WebSocket tunnel;
  - rooms logged and compacted under load;
  - the regression scenarios, five times over, three games a room
    ([docs/REGRESSION.md](docs/REGRESSION.md));
  - a 15-minute soak on Linux.
- **Manual acceptance**, before promoting to `main`, for changes they
  touch:
  - the launcher window, used by hand against a local server: connect,
    create a room, join by invite, start the game from the launcher, play
    (see [docs/PLAYING.md](docs/PLAYING.md)). Until the game is out,
    `--game-exe` names `tpf3mp-fakegame` as the game: "Start Transport
    Fever 3" then starts it with the hook loaded into it, and it must
    join the room. `cargo test -p tpf3mp-launcher --test screenshots --
    --ignored` renders its screens to `target/launcher-screenshots/`, one
    for each sample state of the page it copies, for a look at the layout
    (D20);
  - a server upgrade that keeps running games (see "Upgrades" in
    [docs/OPERATIONS.md](docs/OPERATIONS.md)), when the log format, the
    protocol or persistence changed.
    `tools/acceptance/upgrade-check.sh <old bin dir> <new bin dir>` plays
    it through with the fake game, from `main`'s binaries to the
    candidate's;
  - once the game is out: a real game on each platform
    ([docs/DAY_ONE.md](docs/DAY_ONE.md)).
- **`release`** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs on pushes to `main`.
  Before packaging (also on manual runs), `tpfre verify-build` checks the
  selected native bundle against the private archive on the dedicated
  `tpf3mp-game-builds` runner. Missing inputs or failed checks stop packaging;
  setup is in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#game-update-builds).
  It builds the packages for every platform and attaches them to a draft
  release `v<version>`, the version in `Cargo.toml`. A person reviews the
  draft and publishes it, which creates the tag. Once a version is
  published, `main` needs a version bump before it releases again: bump it
  on a feature branch like any change.

## Promoting

```bash
# a feature into dev: a pull request, merged once its ci run is green
# (and, when it changes the decisions or the plan, the owner approved it)
gh pr create --base dev --head feat/my-change

# dev into acceptance, once ci on dev is green
git switch acceptance && git pull --ff-only
git merge --ff-only dev && git push origin acceptance

# acceptance into main, once ci, acceptance and the manual checks are green
git switch main && git pull --ff-only
git merge --ff-only acceptance && git push origin main
```

Check a branch's runs with `gh run list --branch <branch>`. Promote only
the exact commit those runs tested: if the branch moved since, wait for the
new runs.

## Before starting a task

The team's plan is [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md): what comes next, who
takes it, and a table of asks that conflict with a decision. Before
starting any task, check it against that page and
[docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md). Coding agents in particular:

- **Flag conflicts; do not settle them.** When a task asks for something
  a decision rules out (for example Steam networking or a player as host
  against D2 and D4, joining without the launcher against D11, choosing
  a server against D12, a proxy DLL against D9 and D11), stop and tell
  the person who asked: name the decision and what it says, and ask how
  to go on. Do not quietly build it, and do not quietly build something
  else instead.
- **Mention what changed.** When a task is based on an older version of
  the plan, say which of its items the plan has since changed, as marked
  there with *Changed:* or *Added:*.
- **Fail closed in the plan too.** An action whose channel is not checked
  yet is refused in a multiplayer game, never sent unchecked (PLAN.md,
  Part 3).
- **Keep the plan current.** Tick an item in the change that finishes it.
  A new decision goes into DECISIONS.md first, then the plan follows.
- **Decisions are the owner's.** Only the owner (Juliansgith) makes or
  changes a decision, or settles a question the plan leaves open for
  them. Propose one in a pull request into `dev`: GitHub asks the owner
  to approve any change to `docs/DECISIONS.md` or `docs/PLAN.md`
  (`.github/CODEOWNERS`). Never write a decision, or mark an open
  question decided, on your own or another person's say.

## Rules for every change

- **Rust everywhere; fail closed.** When unsure, refuse, disconnect or set
  aside. Never guess, and never damage a player's game or a room's log.
  Decisions and their reasons are in [docs/DECISIONS.md](docs/DECISIONS.md);
  record a new decision there instead of rewriting an old one.
- **Tests with the change.** A behaviour change comes with a test that fails
  without it. Run `cargo fmt --all`, `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets
  -- -D warnings` and `cargo test --workspace` before pushing.
- **Docs with the change.** Update the doc that describes what changed
  (`docs/PROTOCOL.md`, `docs/OPERATIONS.md`, `docs/PLAYING.md`, …) in the
  same change. Bump `PROTOCOL_VERSION`, `BRIDGE_VERSION` or the log's
  `FORMAT_VERSION` when their format changes.
- **Commit messages** say what changed for players or operators, in the
  imperative ("Let each room's host choose its rules"), with the details in
  the body.
- **Other repositories are read-only.** The sibling TPF2 projects (`tf2mod`,
  `tf2mp-relay`, `tpf2-multiplayer`) and the game install are inputs; never
  modify them. Credit code or test vectors taken from them in the file that
  uses them.
- **The real game only as [docs/GAME_TESTING.md](docs/GAME_TESTING.md)
  says**: with `tools/game`, on the local rig's server, for a real-game test
  the owner asked for or a fix to something that failed in the game; only
  games you started; never another player's or the production server.
- **Secrets stay out of the repository**: keys, certificates and
  `invite.key` included.
